# Project: Blogging Platform

## Description:

The Blogging Platform project aims to develop a web application that allows users to create, publish, and manage their own blogs. It provides a user-friendly interface for writers and readers to interact with blog posts, enabling content creation, publication, and engagement.

## Features:

Considering the requirement for an API, here's an updated breakdown of tasks for the backend development using Express.js, Mongoose.js (with TypeScript), and MongoDB:

### Set Up Project:

- Task 1: Initialize a new Express.js project
- Task 2: Set up TypeScript configuration and project structure
- Task 3: Install and configure Mongoose.js for MongoDB connectivity

### User Authentication and Authorization:

- Task 1: Create user schema and model using Mongoose.js
- Task 2: Implement user registration and password hashing
- Task 3: Develop user login and authentication functionality
- Task 4: Implement user role-based authorization (e.g., admin, regular user)
- Task 5: Set up JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication and user sessions

### Blog Post Management:

- Task 1: Create blog post schema and model using Mongoose.js
- Task 2: Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API endpoints for blog posts
- Task 3: Handle blog post pagination and sorting in API responses
- Task 4: Add API endpoints for retrieving and displaying blog post statistics (e.g., views, likes)
- Task 5: Implement search functionality for blog posts via API

### Comment Management:

- Task 1: Create comment schema and model using Mongoose.js
- Task 2: Implement CRUD API endpoints for comments
- Task 3: Handle comment moderation and filtering within the API
- Task 4: Add API endpoints for users to like and reply to comments
- Task 5: Implement pagination for comments in API responses

### User Profile and Dashboard:

- Task 1: Add API endpoints for updating user profile information
- Task 2: Implement API endpoints for user dashboard with blog post management options
- Task 3: Handle user-related statistics and analytics via API
- Task 4: Integrate API endpoints for profile picture upload functionality
- Task 5: Implement API endpoints for user preferences and settings

### API Design and Documentation:

- Task 1: Design and define RESTful APIs for the backend endpoints
- Task 2: Document the API endpoints, request/response structures, and authentication requirements
- Task 3: Implement API versioning and error handling within the API
- Task 4: Set up API documentation using tools like Swagger or Postman

### Testing and Error Handling:

- Task 1: Write unit tests for backend APIs and functionality
- Task 2: Implement error handling and validation for API requests and responses
- Task 3: Test API endpoints using tools like Postman or Jest
- Task 4: Debug and fix any identified issues or errors
- Task 5: Perform integration testing to ensure seamless interaction between backend components

### Deployment and Security:

- Task 1: Choose a hosting provider or cloud platform for deployment
- Task 2: Configure server environment and deployment settings
- Task 3: Implement security measures, such as encryption and secure connections
- Task 4: Set up logging and monitoring for error tracking and performance analysis
- Task 5: Regularly update and maintain backend dependencies and frameworks

By following these tasks, you'll be able to develop the backend part of your Blogging Platform project with an API that enables communication between the backend and frontend components.
